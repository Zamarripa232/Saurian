This is a personal discord bot for twitch.tv/floydasaurus

## Usage
For this bot to work properly, you must create a token.py file in the root directory that will contain your discord app token. You may also want to update the channel IDs within the code after any client.get_channel seen.

## Current commands
**!d6**: rolls a d6 and reports the result to the specified channel id.
